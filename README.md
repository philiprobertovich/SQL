# SQL

### By Philip Kendall

#### This project utilizes SQL to perform various tasks on a lego database based on MariaDB(MySQL)

## Technologies Used

* GIT
* MariaDB
* Docker
* Beekeeper
* SQL


## Description

Various query and subquery methods are used to get different values within the lego database and its different tables. Aliasing and othe arithmatic operations are used to manipulate some of the data. Aggregate and Group By functions are applied to certain tables to get sums, and averages of certain columns. A JOIN is performed on the parts and the part_categories table and filtered to show only values with a certain string contained within it.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Fork over the the repository to your own Github account.
* Clone your Github repo down to your local machine and into the directory you would like this project to be stored.
* Navigate to the code_review.sql file and open it in your text editor.
* After that, the application should be able to run.
